            <h3>Explanation of Commands</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>router bgp 200: This command tells the router to enter into a configuration mode specifically for
                    Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and to identify itself with a unique number, in this case, 200. BGP is
                    a routing protocol used to exchange routing information between different autonomous systems on the
                    internet.</li>
                <li>network 198.123.2.0: Here, the router is being instructed to advertise to its BGP neighbors (other
                    routers it's connected to via BGP) that it knows how to reach the network with the address range
                    starting from 198.123.2.0. This command indicates that the router is directly connected to this
                    network and can route traffic to it.</li>
                <li>network 198.123.3.0: Similar to the previous command, this one indicates that the router knows how
                    to reach the network with the address range starting from 198.123.3.0 and is instructing BGP to
                    advertise this information to its neighbors.</li>
                <li>neighbor 198.123.2.1 remote-as 100: This command establishes a BGP neighbor relationship with
                    another router identified by the IP address 198.123.2.1. It specifies that this neighbor router is
                    in a different autonomous system (AS) with the AS number 100. BGP uses these neighbor relationships
                    to exchange routing information.</li>
                <li>neighbor 198.123.1.2 remote-as 100: Similar to the previous command, this one establishes a BGP
                    neighbor relationship with another router identified by the IP address 198.123.1.2, also belonging
                    to AS 100.</li>
                <li>exit: This command simply exits the current configuration mode, allowing the user to return to the
                    previous level of configuration or the main command prompt.</li>
